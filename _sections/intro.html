	<p>My name is <strong>Louis Hall</strong>. I'm a Manchester-based developer and programmer with a proficiency in <em>C#</em> and the <em>Unity Engine</em>, although I am broadening my knowledge to <em>C++</em> and some assembly. I also know JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Unreal Engine 4 (Blueprints and C++).
	
	<p>I am currently searching for a job in the game industry, preferrably programming in C# or C++, and in a junior position.
