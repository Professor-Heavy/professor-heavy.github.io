<p>The Team Fortress 2 Asset Manager was created as a personal project, and over time, eventually became one of my sandbox projects, something that I work on occasionally to understand C# more.
<p>The application is in the alpha stage, and capable of modifying very large amounts of files. So far, it is capable of modifying Valve Data Format structures and reading from Valve Pak files. However, using reverse-engineered information, paired with Valve's own SDK, the application will eventually be capable of reading binary file types.
