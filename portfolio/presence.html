<p>Steam-To-Discord Rich Presence is an application for players that allows them to display Rich Presence details on Discord using network events.
<p>The application runs in the background, displaying information from rich presence as it comes in. This information can be configured, and changes depending on what Steam says about the current player's activity. This is done through a library.
