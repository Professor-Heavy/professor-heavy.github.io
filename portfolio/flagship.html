<p>Flagship is a Unity-based spin on the classic twin-stick shooter gameplay style, made as a university project. People who load up the game have the option to choose between either Gunners or Thrusters, taking up the role of shooting or moving respectively. All players belong to the same ship, which is pitted against enemies.
<p>The game uses Photon Unity Networking, or PUN. This allows many players to be in the same room, and has support for RPCs and variable replication.
