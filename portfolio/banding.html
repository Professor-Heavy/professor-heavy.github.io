<p>Banding Together is a Unity game that utilizes the <strong><a href="https://www.un4seen.com/">bass.dll</a></strong> library. Although still in the design phase, hence the lack of images, Banding Together is my most ambitious project, relying on Unity's Native Plugin system and the Module Tracker music format.
<p>Taking inspiration from games like Patapon and games where you control a horde (The Wonderful 101, etc.), this game puts the player in control of a lone drummer, who needs to drum certain commands to control an ever-growing army of allies.
<p>At the moment, the game uses bass.dll. This allows it to play Tracker files and hook events to tracker playback. This way, the game is capable of more accurately measuring timing in music. This is only temporary for now, however, until I can devise my own lightweight method of processing Tracker files.
