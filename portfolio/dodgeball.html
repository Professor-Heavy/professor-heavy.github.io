<p>VR Dodgeball is a game made in the Unreal Engine created as part of a simulated game studio for Manchester Metropolitan University. The game uses VR technology in Unreal Engine for a dodgeball game. The game allows PC and VR players to play against each other.
<p> My role was integrating the Steam API for multiplayer play, while also designing the network aspects, such as Remote Procedure Call flow and variable replication. I also provided assistance for engine and code related issues, and worked on the PC player controls.
