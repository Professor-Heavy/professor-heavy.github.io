<p>Darklight is a game that uses a Joy-Con library to allow inputs from Joy-Cons connected via bluetooth. The two controllers represent two different torches, which are controlled by their individual gyroscope controls. One torch can be used to shine light into the dark, while the other is used to darken the light.
<p>The game is a concept, but was an attempt to branch out to more experimental and unfamiliar technologies such as motion controls and Joy-Con controller support.
