<p>Lateral Labs is a Unity-based puzzle game created as part of a simulated game studio for Manchester Metropolitan University. The game is a top-down puzzle game where the player can fire and retract blocks to solve puzzles. This was a team effort, and I was the lead programmer, joining halfway into the game's production. My contribution towards the team was ensuring a transition from 2D to 3D, making the game more open-ended (using abstraction, inheritence, event systems, and Unity's Component system to this end).
<p>Another way I had made the game open-ended was by creating a level editor, which could write and read JSON files, allowing them to be played as levels in-game.
<p>The game was developed beyond the original university for the 2020 Tranzfuser event and presented.
