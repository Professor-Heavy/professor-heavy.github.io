<p>Swarm is a Unity-based survival game created for Grads in Games' Search For A Star 2020's Programming category. While the game was rated average, the technical application of Swarm had stood out. Swarm is a survival game where the player survives against a Swarm that progresses slowly on the world. While the game was submitted in an incomplete state, it has been updated since the initial submission, getting closer to the full idea.
<p>The game utilized noise and seed generation to generate multiple islands for the player to progress through, and uses Unity's Task System to generate terrain in the background asynchronously without having any adverse effect on user experience.
