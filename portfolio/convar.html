<p>The Valve ConVar Parser is an application inspired from Valve Software's source code. Valve games made in the Source Engine all define their ConVars (Console Variables) in the same way, and this application reads through source code to find these definitions.
<p>This program was my first attempt at creating file parsing intended for a specific format. While I had initially gone with regex, <a href="https://github.com/Professor-Heavy/ValveConvarParser/commit/354e6927d5004cadb8b97347e6a3bfaf1f0a85b5">the system was removed as it was deemed unfit for the purpose.</a> Using a custom parser gave me far more control and was also quite flexible for the purpose.
