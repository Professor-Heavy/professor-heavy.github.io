<p>Beat The Offbeat is a rhythm game controlled by multiple devices, intended to be a party game. 4 players connect to a main computer, one they can all see. In a Simon Says-like game, the screen flashes colours with every song beat. The person with that colour needs to press it to their beat. Due to being made in a single week, the game lacks in some functionalities, but will be improved on in the future.
<p>The game runs in web browsers and uses node.js to run, and uses Socket.IO to communicate with clients. So far, the game uses hard-set timers to simulate the beats of the music, but will probably use a more advanced method in future.
